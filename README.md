# TicTacToe
Practice project making tic tac toe with React

- 9 GridCells arranged like TicTacToe board
    - GridCells highlight when hovered over
    - When clicks, GridCell will display either circle or X depending on parity of move
- Detect when game is over by iterating through rows, columns, and diagonals
    - When one player wins, will display the correct line covering the correct GridCells
- Layer GridCells over black background to create illusion of 4 lines separating them
